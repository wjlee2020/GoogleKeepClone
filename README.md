# Google Keep Clone
Google Keep is a Google app where you can add notes similar to a todo app.
google.com/keep

here is my version:
https://wjlee2020.github.io/GoogleKeepClone/

## Description
The clone works nearly the same way as the google app.
You can add title and text of a note that you want and 
change its background color by hovering over
the color palette tool on the bottom right of each specific note.
If you click anywhere else on the note, you can edit the note from the modal.
You can delete the note by clicking on the trash-bin icon.


## Todo
Currently, if there are more than one row of notes,
the color palette goes down to the bottom most note instead of sticking by the selected note.
Need to figure out how to make proper changes.
